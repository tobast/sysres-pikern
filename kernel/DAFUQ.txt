"That should work that way... Oh, wait."
=====================

* Wrong alignment overwriting vector table
* Malloc linkage was both C and C++. In different headers.
* ".text.startup should be the first text section, it will be all right.
	Oh, wait, there's .text.unlikely before. Why the hell 0x8000 is
	constructing a udp::PckInfos structure?!"
* async_start thinking that the process table will do a wonderful stack for
	the SVC calls.
